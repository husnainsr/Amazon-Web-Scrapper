I bought these Under Armour Charged Asset 9 shoes out of default, trying to find another brand that would hold up to the miles and abuse, because the Rebok, NB and several other name brand shoes I have been wearing only last a few months tops.\\nI've been wearing these almost every workday for almost 4 months with the exception of a few days that it snows, and I am beyond impressed with the minimal wear they are showing. They still have roughly 75% of the tread left, the soles are still attached and not separating, and no holes worn through the very well-made and somewhat thick mesh type material on the top - all of these things I mentioned were common failures of most of the other shoes I've been wearing.\\nAfter the first few days I wore them, I liked them so much that I looked and found some more on Amazon Warehouse at a great price and I snatched them up. I did put my favorite insoles in them, but I do that with all of my shoes, so I can't rate the factory insoles, but overall, I am very impressed with the quality of these shoes.\\nBottom line: If you want some long wearing, very comfortable shoes, give these a shot, I doubt you'll regret it.\"\n",

I have a difficult fit - wide feet - and I wear laser-mapped orthotics prescribed by a podiatrist (which are rock-hard resin and roughly 1/4\\\" thick at the heel,) and these UA shoes - my usual size in X-Wide width - fit like the proverbial glove straight out of the box. So given that I'm using orthotics and Odor Eater inserts on top of that and they fit perfectly, if you're going into these without either of those they will probably be roomy. Maybe dial it back to Wide without the \\\"X\\\" or just Medium width, depending on your usual width choice.\\n\\nI've been wearing these for two full months - at work, where I spend a lot of time on my feet, and even for periodic running - and the fit is so perfect, bind/pain-free and seamless that they're like extensions of my feet. I'd been familiar with UA's socks and other products but had not known they'd gone into athletic shoes. So I took a chance and... was duly blown away. Just perfect.\\n\\nAs work shoes they're rugged without being overly heavy (and given that the heaviest thing that's likely to fall on my toes is a SiGe wafer roughly the size, shape and weight of a nickel, I do not need or want steel toes.) I decided to use them for a run when I forgot my Brooks Ghosts at home, and... these UA Assert 9 shoes surprised me by working just fine as running shoes.\\n\\nI will likely be making Under Armour my go-to source of all-around excellent shoes for the foreseeable future. After flailing around with some duds from other manufacturers, these are quietly amazing. Bravo to all at UA, and thanks. Just a great shoe.\"\n",

I thought the Under Armor Men's Charged Assert 9 Running Shoe might be the shoe I was looking for, and it surely would be, except that these shoes are too short to run in. For many years I have been wearing American size 12 shoes (Nike, Adidas, Rebook, Mizuno) for jogging. The Under Armor that I ordered and received say they are size 12, but it is impossible for me to wear them for jogging. Otherwise, I would like these shoes for what I want them for: walking, kung fu training, and jogging as part of my training routine. If these Under Armor shoes were a size larger, I'm sure they would be perfect for training, but they are very short and I can only walk in them wearing thin socks. I really like the support of the shoes on the ankles. If you are purchasing these shoes for jogging, order them at least one size larger than the ones you usually wear. Amazon should implement some real size verification system to avoid these inconveniences. The actual lengths of Under Armor shoes are definitely shorter than those of Adidas, Nike and Mizuno among others. Would it be possible to request a replacement of the shoes I received with others one size larger?\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"After all these years, (74) this is the first pair of Croc\\u2019s that I\\u2019ve ever purchased. I\\u2019ve tried plastic type shoes in the past that always made my feet feel too warm and sweaty, so I stayed away from these. But I read an article the other day about how the Croc brand was becoming more popular, given a boost by Covid and so many people working from home or just hanging out at home more and buying them. So I took a chance and ordered these Classic Navy Crocs.\\n\\nWhen the package arrived, I couldn\\u2019t believe how unbelievably light in weight they are. I ordered a size 9 which is pretty much what I wear these days. They looked big and clunky and my toe comes quite a ways from the top, but the fit is actually perfect. I thought they would fall off when I walked, but that is not a problem at all. They stay on whether I flip the strap up, or down around the back of my heels. I have never had them slip off so far. When the strap is down around my heel, it fits loosely, but I have to use my other foot or hand to move it down to remove them. When I put it up over the top, I can slip them on and off easier, but they still don\\u2019t come off when I\\u2019m walking. Maybe that\\u2019s due to the little slightly raised dots all over the inside footbed. Just enough to keep my feet from slipping, but not enough to be uncomfortable. There is only the slightest arch support although I tried a pair of thin shoe pads which gave them some cush, a little support, and are pretty much invisible. But they did make my feet sweat a little due to the slightly snugger fit.\\n\\nAlthough there isn\\u2019t much cush to them, they don\\u2019t feel real hard either. We have tile floors throughout most of our downstairs and they aren\\u2019t quite as hard as walking on the floor. I slip them on first thing in the morning, so I guess they are comfortable in their own way. I go barefoot indoors most of the summer anyway, so it isn\\u2019t really an issue. These are like going barefoot with the advantage of protecting the sole of your foot if you step on prickly things. Or in the dog poop on the sidewalk that you didn\\u2019t notice. Speaking of dog poop, tyou can use as much soap and water on these as you want without harming them and they air dry in minutes or dry off with a towel or paper towel instantly.\\n\\nThey certainly are ugly looking, but they grow on you. Sort of like a Bulldog or Persian cat. Within a short while you grow to love them. In fact, I bought a second pair of classic light tie dye Crocs which my Amazon driver delivered yesterday. OMG, light, bright and colorful! Just the thing an old hippie like me could fall in love with! Even my husband said he liked them. (Said he didn\\u2019t think he would ever wear anything like that, but he commented on them several times throughout the day.) They even make a pair of Jimmy Buffet beach Crocs with lime, umbrella, ice cubes and even the \\u201clost shaker of salt\\u201d Jibbitz. Very cool for a Parrothead, but can\\u2019t imagine those accessories that look like they could be dog toys staying on the Crocs!\\n\\nI\\u2019ve only had these around a week, so I can\\u2019t say how long they\\u2019ll last, but they feel sturdy and well made in spite of their incredible lightness.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"SIZING + FIT: 1) I wear an exact women\\u2019s size 8.5. Sometimes size 9 so I can add a Dr Scholl arch insole. I ordered these Crocs in two different sizes so I could try them and return the size that didn\\u2019t work. The size women\\u2019s 9 was too large/loose. The size women\\u2019s 8 fit me best, but not perfect. 2) The right shoe is somewhat larger & looser than the left, and the heel strap is longer. 3) I tried inserting a Dr Scholl insole in these Crocs. It did make the shoes more snug on my feet, and added arch support. The insoles stayed in place. But, it just felt wrong to put an insole in a Croc shoe since I bought these for orthopedic comfort & support, so I removed them. 4) My husband also just ordered these exact Crocs from Amazon in size Men's 11. He normally wears a size 10.5 or 11 shoe. They fit him okay, but they are somewhat loose on his narrow feet and he ends up walking duck-footed, with his toes pointed outward, to keep them from slipping.\\n\\nCOMFORT: 1) After reading A LOT of reviews, I concluded that the comfort of Crocs are unique to each person. People with wider feet seem to really love them. People with foot or back problems love them. People with narrower feet aren\\u2019t usually impressed by them. 2) I sit & stand at my desk all day and these shoes are more comfortable than flip flops, but not as comfortable as high quality sneakers. 3) I have high arches and these shoes are tolerable, but don\\u2019t really offer much arch support. Perhaps my feet will eventually mold to the rubber \\u2013 time will tell. 4) These Crocs have a slight cushioned insole. They are not hard plastic, and the insole has a little bit of cushy give when I take a step. 5) When wearing these shoes for extended periods, I notice pain in the ball of my feet - metatarsals. 6) The little nubs inside these shoes are soft enough that they don\\u2019t bother me or hurt my feet. That says a lot because I have very sensitive feet! 7) I find these shoes to be more comfortable and slip less when I wear them with socks. 8) I have a knock-off brand of Crocs with removeable orthopedic insoles. Those were initially comfortable on my feet, but the longer I wore them the more my feet hurt. The knock-off brand cost MORE than these Crocs ($33 vs $26).\\n\\nLOOKS + COLOR: 1) Well, what can I really say here except I really didn\\u2019t buy these for looks. They look like wide orthopedic shoes. Oh yeah, that\\u2019s because they are! Comfort overruled style in my case. 2) I bought some cute white flower charms on Amazon and that made my Crocs look more feminine and added a little something that was needed. 3) I ordered these in the color CHOCOLATE because I wanted a neutral color that didn\\u2019t draw attention to my huge orthopedic shoes. In the listing photo they look kind of sparkly, but they aren\\u2019t. They are a light, soft brown, almost a taupe color. Later, IF this shoe style grows on me (remember, I\\u2019m a newbie Crock wearer) I may try some other fun colors like pink or red.\\n\\nOTHER + GOOD TO KNOW + TIPS: 1) As other reviewers mention, these shoes squeak as you walk. Each step is \\u201csqueak, squeak, squeak\\u2026\\u201d. 2) In my opinion, Crocs are not ideal for narrow feet like mine. The shoes feel loose and I had them slip off while walking, which could be hazardous. I would not walk in these shoes for long distances or on uneven ground or on steps. 3) I heard that Crocs can be loosened or tightened using a blow dryer or in a clothes dryer. I tried to tighten mine using a blow dryer on high heat, held 6 inches away, then let cool. I was hoping the material would slightly shrink, especially the heel strap which is too loose. Unfortunately, this heat method did not work for me. *If you try this, USE CAUTION so you don't ruin your shoes! 4) I read many reviews where people said their Crocs shrunk or warped when left out in the sun or in a hot vehicle , so keep that in mind. 5) The holes in the plastic help ventilate enough that my feet don\\u2019t get super hot. Yes, my feet sweat a little in these shoes. There is a slight foot odor when wearing without socks. That is to be expected with rubber shoes. 6) I prefer to wear these shoes with socks because it helps with sweating and my feet don\\u2019t slip as much. 7) The tag on these shoes says Made in China. The bottom of the shoe is imprinted with Made in China. They have a tag that warns about riding on escalators and holding children\\u2019s hands at all times. I would never wear these on an escalator, but there must be some reason they include this tag \\u2013 probably because of known issues of the rubber soles getting stuck on escalators. 8) I have no idea if these are \\u201cauthentic\\u201d Crocs because this is my first pair and I have nothing to compare to. I checked the official Crocs\\u2019 website and the shoes I received from Amazon look exactly like those on Crocs\\u2019 website. 9) At the time of this review, I paid $26 for these Crocs on Amazon. This same style on the official Crocs\\u2019 website is priced much higher at $49. Amazon offers a lot more color options than Crocs\\u2019 website. 10) I found where Amazon sells a slightly different style of Croc brand shoes that I might try \\u201cCrocs Unisex-Adult All Terrain Clogs with Adjustable Heel Strap\\u201d. The adjustable heel strap may help in keeping my feet from sliding around. That style is a lot pricier at $41.\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION: As a newbie Croc wearer, I am not totally convinced these shoes live up to all the hype and amazing reviews I read. Like I said, I don\\u2019t think these are ideal for my narrow feet. I don\\u2019t feel safe wearing these outside my house because my feet slip in them so much. I will most likely wear these inside my house, inside my RV or around the campsite. PS- I am really disappointed that these didn\\u2019t meet all my expectations, and I am envious of all the people who rave about these shoes.\\n\\nI paid full price for these Crocs and was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope you found it helpful.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"I only just received my pair and these are my first pair of crocs. I got them for around the house, yard and garage. I\\u2019ll wear them a bit more before I do a full review on them but I just wanted to make a comment on sizing. I found a lot of varying opinions on what size to go with for someone with half sizes. I am men's 11.5, slightly wide feet, with most shoes and I went with the 11. They fit perfectly. A little wiggle room in the toes which I don\\u2019t mind. No slipping or discomfort. I almost always just slip them on and go on my way because they fit well enough that I don't need to use that little ankle strap but with that strap, I feel like I could run in these things. That's how well they fit me. So if you\\u2019re trying to decide on whether you should go up or down a size, I, personally, would recommend going down.\\n\\nUpdate 10/9/2023 (4+ weeks later)\\n\\nSo after a little more than a month of wearing these daily, they have become slightly more comfortable due to the break in period. I wear them every day, usually around the house, and it's probably about an hour of total wear a day. It took me about 2-3 weeks before I really started to notice they were breaking in and shaping around my feet so I guess that you can expect them to shape to your feet after about 15-20 hours. Comfort and fit were never an issue but I definitely notice a difference between day one and today. They're softer underfoot and just seem to fit better now.\\n\\nNot sure what else to really say about them. They fit well, strap up or down, they're going to stay on my feet. The comfort is great especially after the break in period. Plenty of grip on the soles.\\n\\nIf I wanted to complain, and this is about as nit-picky as you can get in my opinion, I would say they've already developed a crease on the sides from me squatting down in them which seemed to happen a little quicker than expected. I don't care about creases but some people do. Creases are going to happen on shoes and if you care, you probably go out of your way to avoid them (which I do not) in which case you will probably be fine.\\n\\nI plan on buying a second pair so I have a pair for in the house and a pair for yard work. I'm not sure I would pay 40+ dollars for them, although they're probably worth that, but I purchased these for 32 dollars. I'll keep an eye on some different colors to see if the price will drop below 35 and, if so, I'll purchase them without hesitation.\\n\\nTL;DR: They're comfortable, especially after the break in period. They fit very well (I'd recommend half sizes go down) with straps up or down. If you're on the fence, I'd recommend you purchase them on sale and you won't be disappointed.\"\n",

I like to wear shoes without socks and they are still fairly comfortable around the house that way.

      "            \"Description\": \"Pros:\\n1. Comfort - I bought these for my son who has wide feet, and bought the next size larger than his current size. He has worn them constantly after sports games he plays in (and he does a lot of sports) because they are super cushiony and provide good support for his arch...and according to him very therapeutic after a game, helping his feet to \\\"relax.\\\" Both he and my husband have worn his slides at different times and both commented on how comfortable they are. And he grew into them perfectly, even able to wear them when they were a little too big.\\n\\n2. Durability - he has had these for almost a year, and wears them around the house, and after games, out and about. Outside and inside. They look the same as when we bought them in terms of not seeing noticeable wear and tear like scuffs or scratches or dents. They are very plain-looking, black slides, but other than getting dirt on them which is washable, they have held up for the last year well.\\n\\n3. Slides that provide arch support - the cushion is perfectly proportioned throughout the slide, while providing arch support, which to me is a nice bonus and good to wear after sporting events. They also help alleviate some of the pain his heel causes him by distributing the weight on his feet well.\\n\\n4. Fit - the shoe stays on well (even when it was a size too big for my son), without any issues of it coming off when walking and even running. It \\\"hugs\\\" the foot well, even though he has a wide foot. Not sure how it would fit for someone who has narrow feet.\\n\\nCons:\\n1.

Plain, but that fits my son's tastes best because he doesn't like flashy shoes. They serve a purpose - comfort and relaxation.\\n\\nI would and am probably going to buy this shoe again for my son when he grows out of them, and if it's as durable as it's been this last year, I'll probably end up giving my son's to his father.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"LONG, DETAILED REVIEW: I received my OoFos recovery slides 11 days ago and have only taken them off while sleeping (and part of one day as a test) because I LOVE THEM. My feet and knees started feeling better immediately. The arch support, the shock absorption and the rocker bottom that takes pressure off the heel are everything the company says. For reference, I wear a women\\u2019s size 10.5 with an average width. I have low arches, over pronate (ankles/feet roll to the inside), have plantar fasciitis and a painful heel from stepping on a sharp rock while running. I prefer a wide toe box so my toes can spread naturally. If the toe box isn\\u2019t wide it crams my big toe into the others and quickly becomes painful (I could see that turning into\\na hammer toe if not careful). The slides have a great toe box but, as everyone knows, wide toe boxes are not necessarily \\u201cpretty\\u201d in women\\u2019s shoes. Screw fashion; I need my feet to make a living and enjoy my life.\\n\\nI purchased a woman\\u2019s 11 which is fine for me but probably could have done the size 10. I\\u2019t\\u2019s ok, I\\u2019d rather that they be slightly big than a little too small. I will try to include photos if that helps people make their decisions.\\n\\nI already wear shoes with arch support from morning until night. I slip on shoes before getting out of bed and even wear swimmer\\u2019s sandals with arch support when I\\u2019m in the shower. Yes, that is how much foot pain I have. If I can\\u2019t be mobile I can\\u2019t work in my profession so I\\u2019ve gotta do what I can. I\\u2019ve tried rotating through different shoes while at work and for that reason I have 4 different pairs waiting on the floor at work at any given time. So the only real change I\\u2019ve made so far is that I\\u2019ve been wearing these OoFas slides instead of my regular shoes that also have good arch support. My foot pain had gotten so bad that when I get a new pair of shoes of the same brand and model that worked for me previously my feet hurt as if I\\u2019ve already worn the shoes out.\\n\\nI have spent at least $850 on shoes costing $80-125 during the last 1.5 year trying to find something that can handle the abuse my feet endure by working 12-14 hours a day on concrete. I\\u2019ve been wearing these slides at work whenever possible even though they aren\\u2019t really a professional style just because I needed something and needed it fast. Previous to this the plantar fasciitis has been so excruciating that I am hobbling on and off and I cannot endure any of my usual athletic activities. My whole body is affected including my knees, hips and low back. With these shoes the PF is markedly improved already. Unbelievable. As a test I slipped my newest, most comfy running shoes on briefly on each day, stood there and took a few steps. Each time I feel my feet and knees start hurting immediately so I put the slides back on. After 1 day of wearing the slides I felt the muscles in my low back were noticeably loosening up so there has been some popping and relief in that area too.\\n\\nIt did take me about an hour of getting used to the arch support and lower heel. I could feel some stretching so I took it slow walking in them at first so I wouldn\\u2019t hurt myself. After that I became less focused on that and just enjoyed the shock absorption and arch support.\\n\\nI know the support and shock absorption of these slides will only hold up so long, like with most athletic shoes. I use a Fitbit and log about 200 miles per month (and that\\u2019s when I\\u2019m not very active due to all this pain I\\u2019ve had). If I remember correctly, most athletic shoes should be replaced every 300 miles (that\\u2019s about 6 weeks for me) because I wear athletic shoes all day long at work so they don\\u2019t last long. So I\\u2019d be happy if these slides held up a month wearing them everyday, all day. Most people probably don\\u2019t put in as many miles as I do. To some people it might seem like $50 is a waste but in all honesty I\\u2019d spend $50 a month to deal with a lot less pain and return to my normal more active lifestyle. When I bought these I was desperate for some relief ASAP. I feel like after a couple more weeks I may be able to wear other shoes for part of the day again.\\n\\nI\\u2019m waiting on some other shoes designed for PF and knee pain to arrive so I\\u2019ll continue wearing these slides from the moment I get out of bed until I hit the hay again. I\\u2019ll check back in later for an updated review.\\n\\nSome things mentioned in other reviews - I personally did not notice a chemical smell with my shoes and I\\u2019m sensitive to chemicals so I would notice. I\\u2019ve not had slippage toward the front of the shoe but I\\u2019ve been wearing black athletic ankle socks with them so it\\u2019s not as obvious that I\\u2019m wearing sandals at work. LOL Even with socks I\\u2019ve had no trouble at all sliding them on but my foot isn\\u2019t wide and I do not have a high instep. I generally wear average width shoes. It does take a bit to get used to the feel of less pressure on your heel while walking or standing if you\\u2019ve never had a shoe with some degree of a rocker sole and prominent arch support. The rocker is part of how they work to relieve pain. I\\u2019ve not noticed any significant wear on the bottom but I do wear them mostly indoors and I don\\u2019t drag my feet.\\n\\nDepending on your foot and joint issues they may or may not be the right shoe for you but if you are flat footed, have PF or other foot/knee/leg joint pain they are worth a try. If you experience supination (weight falls more on the outside) anything with this level of arch support and a heel drop may not be a good fit for you but it\\u2019s up to you to try. If you do a lot of lateral movements this slide might not support your heel enough during those lateral activities but that is expected...it is a slide and it\\u2019s marketed as a comfy shoe to get some relief after exercise and not for everyday wear. I know I\\u2019m not wearing mine as they were intended to be worn because I wear them all day but they are helping me so far so I\\u2019m going with it.\"\n",

Only issue is that the blue size 9s I ordered were a little big and felt more like a 9.5 or 10, but they were comfortable and I was just going to use them as slippers so I kept them. I thought the 8 might be too small. Well, I saw a black pair in size 9 at Academy Sports and they fit perfectly so I'm not sure why the ones I ordered were too big. So if the size seems off, maybe try another pair in the same size. I guess that pair was just irregular. Awesome sandals. I want to try the clogs and tennis shoes next.\"\n",

I\\u2019m a size 5 usually wearing 5.5 for closed shoes like sneakers or boots(for more toe space inside), open shoes(like sandals and flip flops and slip one) I wear my regular 5 since my toes r already exposed to the outside. This fits perfectly well for my size, my measurements are abt 8.25 inches which is basically size 5, this is a unisex shoe so a 5 would automatically mean larger for me(obviously wear women\\u2019s size). But this isn\\u2019t the case, THIS FITS SO WELL. IT FITS!!!! Like there\\u2019s no uncomfortable tightness or feels loose or too big, it literally just fits right for me. Enough toe space inside too and not even concerned abt the size anymore, this is literally perfect!!! \\ud83d\\ude2d You don\\u2019t exactly need to break in these boots, the soles are thick and hard, it actually makes me feel more free moving that way since it\\u2019s rigid and it does feel like bouncing every step you take. It just guides you instead of moving with your feet. One thing I don\\u2019t like is how tight or closed the opening it when you\\u2019re wearing it for a while, also getting it on barefoot was just a nightmare, must wear socks so it just slips on easily instead :) these thigh highs go so well with these boots \\ud83d\\ude0d\\nOverall, I would rate this a 8.9/10.

Super high value, if you need a durable pair of boots to wear intermittently to keep your feet dry they are awesome. Such as a couple of hours a day doing farm chores, perfect for that.\\n\\nIf its cold out, and the boots are cool/cold, such as from sitting over night in an unheated garage, your feet are going to be cold, even with wool socks. These things get cold and stay that way for a long time. If you start the day with these cold your feet are going to freeze all day. I can feel them sucking the heat out of my feet.\\n\\nI have huge calves and struggle to wear rubber boots besides ankle boots. The sheaths on these are larger than average and they just fit. I wish they were a little bigger to make it easier to tuck my pants into.\\n\\nI wear 10.5 in Ariat square toes, which start tight and break in just right. I bought these in an 11 and even with thick wool socks they are too loose.\\n\\nThey offer no ankle support. The sheath material is very pliable, they won't even stand up under their own weight. That being said the design is very trim, not clunky.\\n\\nThey have very aggressive tread, which for my use is a good thing, I bought them to slop around in the winter clay mud.\\n\\nBottom line: for occasional use, on a budget these are hard to beat, if you plan on working in them all day every day look elsewhere if your budget permits. And remember these are made in the US at competitive prices to other options... that is reason enough to buy them over other options in the price range.\"\n",

I'm a landscape photographer, with a lot of hiking involved. I couldn't wait to try them out. I found, in a wooded relatively flat terrain,it's a 10 of 10, and in moutainous rocky terrain a 6 of 10. In rocky hill terrain, the grip was only average and the bottom of my feet were a briefly sore after. However, this style of boot was not made for heavy hiking, I was just pushing it a little. These boots are for comfort, style, and lite hiking, and they deliver!\"\n",

I mostly wear the sketchers \\\"middle aged dad\\\" wide fit shoes that are well known for being pretty close to slippers comfort but also have to wear steel toes for work so I have good comparison points. These are very close to the sketchers, not quite, but enough that more often than not I end up wearing these instead as they are still super comfortable. I normally wear a 12 wide, so I bought a 12 regular expecting it to stretch and it in fact was very narrow and tight at first. The third use it felt great, the 5th time (after having walked about a mile in total in them) they were broken in. After wearing about 50 times now I can say that I love these and they fit me nearly perfect. The laces provided are too short for the number of eyelets in my opinion so I dont tie the top 2 rows (or maybe my feet are actually too wide) and the toe was longer than expected. These are not shiny, a matte black so they dont stand out too much, but nice enough to use as casual dress shoes. However due to the lower shine they are super easy to clean and dont show scratches as much, fairly durable so far. If there are scraches or cracks on mine I havent found them yet. Perfect for lots of walking, has a similar spring and cushon in your step comparable to name brand crocs, but you know way more comfortable. Warm enough for mild cold with thick socks which even fit with me despite how tight they were, but not too hot with thin sport socks even in the summer. Sure they arent gonna handle snow and ice that well but for Louisiana winters they are perfect, however I wear mine year around even in summer, they are just that good.\"\n",

Luckily, I have been able to correct some of the reasons my feet always ache and I am planning a busy trip to London and Paris. I will need to be on my feet a lot for 9 straight days so I am looking for some really comfortable shoes, but of course they can't be just any shoes, they need to be able to fit in wherever I go whether it be in church or strolling through a garden. In my search for the \\\"perfect\\\" footwear I came across a big following for these Cole Haan 2.Zerogrand wingtip Oxfords. I figured why not give these a try. I'm sure glad I did! The thing is these shoes are comfortable in a whole new way. They don't surround your fit in cushy memory foam, but they're actually built to fit and not create pressure points and they are really good. I was shocked by the way these fit, just incredibly comfortable. I'm very pleased with these shoes and can easily recommend them to others.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"I purchased this shoe as well as a pair of the Skecher Afterburn M tennis shoes. I wanted a dedicated work shoe, because I was going though my shoes pretty quickly from wearing the same pair all the time. So, being that I had already had two previous pairs of the \\u201cAfterburn\\u201d shoe, and burned through each of them in just over a year respectively, I decided to get another pair of them and also get a pair of the Cessnock Food Service Shoe strictly for work. Both pairs of shoes arrived yesterday, and today I wore the Food Service shoe (FSS) to work for the first time.\\n\\nI slipped them on and found them to be a perfect fit. They are very light weight and comfortable. Usually, I find new shoes need a few days of wear to break-in until they really conform to the shape of your foot and then begin to fit well, but that wasn\\u2019t the case with these FSS shoes; they fit perfectly the moment I put them on.\\n\\nI wore them all day at work and discovered something that really surprised me. We had a snowstorm today and got about 2\\u201d by the time I got to work, and had a good 7\\u201d by the end of my shift. I park outside so of course I have to brush the snow off the car. After doing so I knocked the snow off my shoes before getting into the car. I was surprised to see that the snow didn\\u2019t stick to the material on top of the shoes, it was as if there was a water repellant in/on the material. I was sort of wondering why my feet weren\\u2019t getting cold while I was cleaning off my car and I guess that explains it. Another surprise was the fact that these shoes make no sound when walking on a tile floor while having wet soles. The \\u201cAfterburn\\u201d tennis shoes squeak like a rusty hinge when the bottom of the shoe is wet and you walk across tile or other such surfaces, but the FSS\\u2019s, are quiet as a mouse, not a sound comes from them, you could almost call them Ninja shoes.\\nAs for the style, well that\\u2019s a personal preference and these shoes suit me just fine. I think they look sharp, and nobody even noticed I had a new pair of shoes on today.\\n\\nDurability is the unanswered question and being that I\\u2019ve only worn them one day, that question will remain unanswered for a while. If I can get a solid two years out of them, just wearing them to work, I will definitely buy them again and certainly would recommend them to a friend.\\n\\nI hope this review helps with your decision. Peace.\"\n",

They were the best shoes I've ever had. Bought these put of necessity and while the shoes hurt to wear the first couple pf days, these took far less time than the last pair I owned and are even better.\\n\\nI have extremely wide feet at the toes due to growing up \\\"toe-walking\\\" with a very narrow heel, so on the rare occasion I can find shoes that fit my width even a little, my heel comes put when I walk. My feet would also rip them apart within months. The slightly stretchy material of these shoes accommodate my wide toes but keep my heels in place. My last pair didn't suffer any damage due to my feet and only due to normal wear and tear.\\n\\nI even bought a size 11 (no wide) and it fits my weird feet fantastically.

The toe box feels longer than a 12, but like I just stated, my feet do not slide in the shoes and no blisters form. I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE WORK SHOES\\n\\nThe shoes actually look great as well.

I have a narrow foot and have always ordered narrow when available. Usually, I end up getting medium as these shoes are and yet it's snug on my foot and my big toe is right at the end of the shoe. I really wear a size 11-1/2, but that wasn't available and I'm so glad that I got the 12. I've had 3 major back surgeries with a spine that's fused at six levels with the bulk in the lumbar region. That's what made these shoes so alluring but probably the issue is you must stand for the \\\"slip-on\\\" feature to actually work. While sitting, the only way I can get my foot in is with a shoehorn. Other than that, they are very light weight, very comfortable and good value for the money. Next time, I'm going to try ordering a wide to see if that helps.\\nRevised Dec. 04, 2023 - Since my initial review, like any shoe I should have waited to comment as the shoe now slips on fairly easy and has conformed to fit my foot so it's not quite as tight. Still think the size may run slightly smaller than normal for most people, but I'm now very happy with the shoes as a whole!\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"Now that I've had these for a month now, and wear them 12 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week, I feel confident they've had time to break in. Initially, they were a little stiff. I expected them to be a little tight, so I ordered half a size larger than regular sneakers, but I realized that appears unnecessary as there is plenty of room in the toe.\\n\\nAfter a couple of days I started to feel a seam in the liner that was bothering me across my little toe, and I was not wearing these every day yet, but I decided to press on to see if they broke in by wearing them daily and eventually I forgot about it. When I remembered I realized they were no longer bothering me. That was about a week. I've now worn them four weeks.\\n\\nI spray them with Tinactin deodorant after every use, because my foot gets fairly wet with sweat after 12 hours and I've previously had trouble with athletes foot. I know fungus can build up in shoes worn too often, and this can not only cause athletes foot, but also break down the material in the shoe itself. The shoe needs to dry out between uses.\\n\\nAlso worth noting, the memory foam insole is comfortable, but not my preference. It is not however, removable, and there is insufficient space to double-up insoles. I have run in these a fair distance and short jaunts, and kicks, and side-stepping and have never felt the steel toe. The sole is stiff and squeaks on some surfaces, and walking through puddles causes no leaks. The top is tuff also, minor scrapes cause no damage. Of course YMMV, I wear these in a warehouse only and change in the car. They are a little dusty from the black dust in the warehouse, but no dirt or mud. Mud and salts can dry the material and cause cracking and rotting. How some have reported such damage so quickly I cannot say, but these appear to hold up very well for my usage, although I do believe the insole will be the first to go. Which is why I don't like memory foam for insoles. They are great for comfort for a large variety of foot shapes, but they are not as durable as a specific-shaped insoles. I plan on getting a black pair to alternate with these.\\n\\nThe only desires I have in these is a composite toe that doesn't set off a metal detector, and a lower price. I ordered the beige style that is somehow twice the price of the black style. I don't know the difference as to why. $50 is outstanding, $90 is worth it, but why pay more?\"\n",

Usually at that point the shoe exterior is still pretty good (and pretty dirty) and the memory foam insert is about shot. Unfortunately a few weeks ago I stopped ankle deep in a mud hole on a work trip and by the time I got home the toes had curled up a bit. I tried working them out but decided to just replace them. At 50 bucks a pair and at least a year to a year and a half is a dang good deal. They are comfortable enough to wear all day and drive home in while providing work protection needed.\\nIn short they are solid and with every penny.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"I got tired of my normal athletic shoes going bad from the stress of daily use on the job, so I went looking under the search term \\\"durable work shoes.\\\" (Looking via Duck and Swisscows and Qwant, mind you, not via Amazon's own search fields, which, inexplicably, continue to be left as almost 100% useless.)\\n\\nInevitably, nothing that was classified as a.) a shoe and b.) \\\"durable\\\" was available without a steel toe, so I relented and bought these. For the record: The heaviest thing I'm likely to drop on my feet is a disk of Lanthanum/Telluride alloy (or maybe Silicon/Germanium,) that's roughly the size, shape and weight of a U.S. Nickel, so I'm not really in need of steel-toed shoes. But if you want \\\"durable,\\\" apparently you have to get the Medieval Class toe box, so I just bought them.\\n\\nI don't know if it's just the steel toe or a combination of that and the heavier-duty rubber and upper material, but these shoes are seriously heavy. Not a big problem if you like the added exercise, but it would be great if shoe manufacturers would offer a version of the exact same work shoe with all of the exact same materials, but without the m\\u00ebtal hardware. But I knew that going in so...\\n\\nThese are excellent shoes despite the weight. I have wide feet and they're available in EE width (if they hadn't been I simply would not have bought them, because \\\"you can't be cool if your feet are uptight,\\\" as the old Hush Puppies ad used to say.) They're built like tanks but are perfectly comfortable nonetheless, and I'm on my feet roughly 80% of every nine-hour workday.\\n\\nI got my normal size and width, and even with a pair of podiatrist-prescribed orthotic inserts and Odor-Eater pads, they fit perfectly. When I put them on in the morning the toe areas do feel tight, but the inserts settle within minutes and they're a perfect fit thereafter. So be aware that if you do not use any kind of insert these might be a little roomy. The laces are also heavy-duty and the eyelets for them allow you to tighten them without messing with the loop-by-loop finger-pull thing - but neither do they let loose too easily - all of which I like lots.\\n\\nGiven the excellent price, durability and fit, I'm really happy that I picked these. Time will tell how well they'll hold up, but I've been wearing them on the job for two months and they still look and feel brand-new. I'm on hands and knees and crawling into the guts of systems and lab equipment frequently, and though the inevitable dirt is there, I don't even see so much as a scuff on the outer surfaces, anywhere. Good shoes, if seriously heavy in the weight class.\"\n",

I use slides in the winter as house shoes, with or without socks, and to go to the pool for lap swims. In warmer weather, I use Rainbow or Cobian Drain-O flip-flops.

Initially, I thought they were a little big. I think that was because I was used to the velcro top piece on the other slides. These feel great with or without socks. A size 12 certainly would have been too small.\\nSupport is good.

I loved how the water could drip out of the holes too. They had a diamond pattern with a smooth area for the heel.\\n\\nThey changed their design so the foot surface has concentric, ridged circles leading to the heel and lines of ridged areas for the toes. The foot strap has gotten tighter.\\n\\nAmazon had recommended I get a size 7, but size 7 is too small. I wear an 8 - 8.5 Women's normally.\\nBased on the size chart, it is what I should order, but it is too small and tight.\\n\\nI have tried several variations of size 9 and 11 now - 5 pairs. There are subtle and not so subtle quality differences in each pair I ordered. I very rarely return Amazon items, but trying to find a pair of shoes that fit has been a quest.\\n\\nThe size 9 at its best is 29 cm, but one pair, it must have shrunk because it was 28 cm.\\nI have noticed between three different size 9's in the hole cutting into my foot and the ridged, concentric rings near the heel cutting into my foot and making it red and sore. Some pairs of shoes, the ridges seem more sharp than others. Also, the band that goes across the foot and across seems to shrink and get tighter after a week. It sounded wierd when people thought their shoes shrunk from leaving them out, but mine have only been in the house, and they had gone from initially comfortable to smaller and tighter.\\n\\nThe size 11 is 31 cm in length. Even though it is about 2\\\" or 6 cm too long for my foot, my heel sits more squarely in the smooth heel circle area instead of being rubbed against the ribbed, concentric rings, so I think it will be more comfortable for standing in while I cook. The band around the foot is also looser and not rubbing like the size 9's. The picture shows the size 11's and the concentric rings I am talking about. For some reason, my left foot is more sensitive to the concentric rings when my heel is pushed against them in a size 9 and it is uncomfortable and even a bit painful.\\n\\nI had also bought a size 10, but that did not provide enough heel length or extra strap space around my foot, so that didn't work either.\\n\\nI would suggest look at the size chart and measure your feet but buy a size that is at least 2 - 4 sizes bigger, since the shoes do feel smaller and tighter from when you first take them out of the bag to leaving them sitting on top of the bag for a week, they shrink somehow. 4 sizes bigger if you perhaps want your heel to sit on the flat area as opposed to rubbing against the concentric rings but it will have extra length.\\n\\nAlso, near the toes is a raised hill. I think if the shoe fits right, it can help grip under your toes to keep the shoe on better, but if you feet are swollen or you don't have your foot in the right place, they can end up rubbing your foot or toes in a bad way. I notice it on my left foot but not my right foot as much.\\n\\nIf you have a high arch, I don't think these shoes would be good for you, because the foot strap is so tight that it would not give you room and it would rub on the top of your foot.\\n\\nI really wish Under Armour did not change their shoe design, since my most favorite, comfortable pair of shoes has become more of a case to find a pair that do not rub or hurt my feet as much.\"\n",

This shoe is light and is so much more comfortable than ALL my other shoes! I\\u2019m beyond excited to wear these moving forward.

I bought these Under Armour Charged Asset 9 shoes out of default, trying to find another brand that would hold up to the miles and abuse, because the Rebok, NB and several other name brand shoes I have been wearing only last a few months tops.\\nI've been wearing these almost every workday for almost 4 months with the exception of a few days that it snows, and I am beyond impressed with the minimal wear they are showing. They still have roughly 75% of the tread left, the soles are still attached and not separating, and no holes worn through the very well-made and somewhat thick mesh type material on the top - all of these things I mentioned were common failures of most of the other shoes I've been wearing.\\nAfter the first few days I wore them, I liked them so much that I looked and found some more on Amazon Warehouse at a great price and I snatched them up. I did put my favorite insoles in them, but I do that with all of my shoes, so I can't rate the factory insoles, but overall, I am very impressed with the quality of these shoes.\\nBottom line: If you want some long wearing, very comfortable shoes, give these a shot, I doubt you'll regret it.\"\n",

I have a difficult fit - wide feet - and I wear laser-mapped orthotics prescribed by a podiatrist (which are rock-hard resin and roughly 1/4\\\" thick at the heel,) and these UA shoes - my usual size in X-Wide width - fit like the proverbial glove straight out of the box. So given that I'm using orthotics and Odor Eater inserts on top of that and they fit perfectly, if you're going into these without either of those they will probably be roomy. Maybe dial it back to Wide without the \\\"X\\\" or just Medium width, depending on your usual width choice.\\n\\nI've been wearing these for two full months - at work, where I spend a lot of time on my feet, and even for periodic running - and the fit is so perfect, bind/pain-free and seamless that they're like extensions of my feet. I'd been familiar with UA's socks and other products but had not known they'd gone into athletic shoes. So I took a chance and... was duly blown away. Just perfect.\\n\\nAs work shoes they're rugged without being overly heavy (and given that the heaviest thing that's likely to fall on my toes is a SiGe wafer roughly the size, shape and weight of a nickel, I do not need or want steel toes.) I decided to use them for a run when I forgot my Brooks Ghosts at home, and... these UA Assert 9 shoes surprised me by working just fine as running shoes.\\n\\nI will likely be making Under Armour my go-to source of all-around excellent shoes for the foreseeable future. After flailing around with some duds from other manufacturers, these are quietly amazing. Bravo to all at UA, and thanks. Just a great shoe.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"I was looking for a good pair of shoes to replace the WHITIN Men's Cross Trainer in which I injured my right foot when stepping on a small stone while walking on a cobblestone street. I thought the Under Armor Men's Charged Assert 9 Running Shoe might be the shoe I was looking for, and it surely would be, except that these shoes are too short to run in. For many years I have been wearing American size 12 shoes (Nike, Adidas, Rebook, Mizuno) for jogging. The Under Armor that I ordered and received say they are size 12, but it is impossible for me to wear them for jogging. Otherwise, I would like these shoes for what I want them for: walking, kung fu training, and jogging as part of my training routine. If these Under Armor shoes were a size larger, I'm sure they would be perfect for training, but they are very short and I can only walk in them wearing thin socks. I really like the support of the shoes on the ankles. If you are purchasing these shoes for jogging, order them at least one size larger than the ones you usually wear. Amazon should implement some real size verification system to avoid these inconveniences. The actual lengths of Under Armor shoes are definitely shorter than those of Adidas, Nike and Mizuno among others. Would it be possible to request a replacement of the shoes I received with others one size larger?\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"After all these years, (74) this is the first pair of Croc\\u2019s that I\\u2019ve ever purchased. I\\u2019ve tried plastic type shoes in the past that always made my feet feel too warm and sweaty, so I stayed away from these. But I read an article the other day about how the Croc brand was becoming more popular, given a boost by Covid and so many people working from home or just hanging out at home more and buying them. So I took a chance and ordered these Classic Navy Crocs.\\n\\nWhen the package arrived, I couldn\\u2019t believe how unbelievably light in weight they are. I ordered a size 9 which is pretty much what I wear these days. They looked big and clunky and my toe comes quite a ways from the top, but the fit is actually perfect. I thought they would fall off when I walked, but that is not a problem at all. They stay on whether I flip the strap up, or down around the back of my heels. I have never had them slip off so far. When the strap is down around my heel, it fits loosely, but I have to use my other foot or hand to move it down to remove them. When I put it up over the top, I can slip them on and off easier, but they still don\\u2019t come off when I\\u2019m walking. Maybe that\\u2019s due to the little slightly raised dots all over the inside footbed. Just enough to keep my feet from slipping, but not enough to be uncomfortable. There is only the slightest arch support although I tried a pair of thin shoe pads which gave them some cush, a little support, and are pretty much invisible. But they did make my feet sweat a little due to the slightly snugger fit.\\n\\nAlthough there isn\\u2019t much cush to them, they don\\u2019t feel real hard either. We have tile floors throughout most of our downstairs and they aren\\u2019t quite as hard as walking on the floor. I slip them on first thing in the morning, so I guess they are comfortable in their own way. I go barefoot indoors most of the summer anyway, so it isn\\u2019t really an issue. These are like going barefoot with the advantage of protecting the sole of your foot if you step on prickly things. Or in the dog poop on the sidewalk that you didn\\u2019t notice. Speaking of dog poop, tyou can use as much soap and water on these as you want without harming them and they air dry in minutes or dry off with a towel or paper towel instantly.\\n\\nThey certainly are ugly looking, but they grow on you. Sort of like a Bulldog or Persian cat. Within a short while you grow to love them. In fact, I bought a second pair of classic light tie dye Crocs which my Amazon driver delivered yesterday. OMG, light, bright and colorful! Just the thing an old hippie like me could fall in love with! Even my husband said he liked them. (Said he didn\\u2019t think he would ever wear anything like that, but he commented on them several times throughout the day.) They even make a pair of Jimmy Buffet beach Crocs with lime, umbrella, ice cubes and even the \\u201clost shaker of salt\\u201d Jibbitz. Very cool for a Parrothead, but can\\u2019t imagine those accessories that look like they could be dog toys staying on the Crocs!\\n\\nI\\u2019ve only had these around a week, so I can\\u2019t say how long they\\u2019ll last, but they feel sturdy and well made in spite of their incredible lightness.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"SIZING + FIT: 1) I wear an exact women\\u2019s size 8.5. Sometimes size 9 so I can add a Dr Scholl arch insole. I ordered these Crocs in two different sizes so I could try them and return the size that didn\\u2019t work. The size women\\u2019s 9 was too large/loose. The size women\\u2019s 8 fit me best, but not perfect. 2) The right shoe is somewhat larger & looser than the left, and the heel strap is longer. 3) I tried inserting a Dr Scholl insole in these Crocs. It did make the shoes more snug on my feet, and added arch support. The insoles stayed in place. But, it just felt wrong to put an insole in a Croc shoe since I bought these for orthopedic comfort & support, so I removed them. 4) My husband also just ordered these exact Crocs from Amazon in size Men's 11. He normally wears a size 10.5 or 11 shoe. They fit him okay, but they are somewhat loose on his narrow feet and he ends up walking duck-footed, with his toes pointed outward, to keep them from slipping.\\n\\nCOMFORT: 1) After reading A LOT of reviews, I concluded that the comfort of Crocs are unique to each person. People with wider feet seem to really love them. People with foot or back problems love them. People with narrower feet aren\\u2019t usually impressed by them. 2) I sit & stand at my desk all day and these shoes are more comfortable than flip flops, but not as comfortable as high quality sneakers. 3) I have high arches and these shoes are tolerable, but don\\u2019t really offer much arch support. Perhaps my feet will eventually mold to the rubber \\u2013 time will tell. 4) These Crocs have a slight cushioned insole. They are not hard plastic, and the insole has a little bit of cushy give when I take a step. 5) When wearing these shoes for extended periods, I notice pain in the ball of my feet - metatarsals. 6) The little nubs inside these shoes are soft enough that they don\\u2019t bother me or hurt my feet. That says a lot because I have very sensitive feet! 7) I find these shoes to be more comfortable and slip less when I wear them with socks. 8) I have a knock-off brand of Crocs with removeable orthopedic insoles. Those were initially comfortable on my feet, but the longer I wore them the more my feet hurt. The knock-off brand cost MORE than these Crocs ($33 vs $26).\\n\\nLOOKS + COLOR: 1) Well, what can I really say here except I really didn\\u2019t buy these for looks. They look like wide orthopedic shoes. Oh yeah, that\\u2019s because they are! Comfort overruled style in my case. 2) I bought some cute white flower charms on Amazon and that made my Crocs look more feminine and added a little something that was needed. 3) I ordered these in the color CHOCOLATE because I wanted a neutral color that didn\\u2019t draw attention to my huge orthopedic shoes. In the listing photo they look kind of sparkly, but they aren\\u2019t. They are a light, soft brown, almost a taupe color. Later, IF this shoe style grows on me (remember, I\\u2019m a newbie Crock wearer) I may try some other fun colors like pink or red.\\n\\nOTHER + GOOD TO KNOW + TIPS: 1) As other reviewers mention, these shoes squeak as you walk. Each step is \\u201csqueak, squeak, squeak\\u2026\\u201d. 2) In my opinion, Crocs are not ideal for narrow feet like mine. The shoes feel loose and I had them slip off while walking, which could be hazardous. I would not walk in these shoes for long distances or on uneven ground or on steps. 3) I heard that Crocs can be loosened or tightened using a blow dryer or in a clothes dryer. I tried to tighten mine using a blow dryer on high heat, held 6 inches away, then let cool. I was hoping the material would slightly shrink, especially the heel strap which is too loose. Unfortunately, this heat method did not work for me. *If you try this, USE CAUTION so you don't ruin your shoes! 4) I read many reviews where people said their Crocs shrunk or warped when left out in the sun or in a hot vehicle , so keep that in mind. 5) The holes in the plastic help ventilate enough that my feet don\\u2019t get super hot. Yes, my feet sweat a little in these shoes. There is a slight foot odor when wearing without socks. That is to be expected with rubber shoes. 6) I prefer to wear these shoes with socks because it helps with sweating and my feet don\\u2019t slip as much. 7) The tag on these shoes says Made in China. The bottom of the shoe is imprinted with Made in China. They have a tag that warns about riding on escalators and holding children\\u2019s hands at all times. I would never wear these on an escalator, but there must be some reason they include this tag \\u2013 probably because of known issues of the rubber soles getting stuck on escalators. 8) I have no idea if these are \\u201cauthentic\\u201d Crocs because this is my first pair and I have nothing to compare to. I checked the official Crocs\\u2019 website and the shoes I received from Amazon look exactly like those on Crocs\\u2019 website. 9) At the time of this review, I paid $26 for these Crocs on Amazon. This same style on the official Crocs\\u2019 website is priced much higher at $49. Amazon offers a lot more color options than Crocs\\u2019 website. 10) I found where Amazon sells a slightly different style of Croc brand shoes that I might try \\u201cCrocs Unisex-Adult All Terrain Clogs with Adjustable Heel Strap\\u201d. The adjustable heel strap may help in keeping my feet from sliding around. That style is a lot pricier at $41.\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION: As a newbie Croc wearer, I am not totally convinced these shoes live up to all the hype and amazing reviews I read. Like I said, I don\\u2019t think these are ideal for my narrow feet. I don\\u2019t feel safe wearing these outside my house because my feet slip in them so much. I will most likely wear these inside my house, inside my RV or around the campsite. PS- I am really disappointed that these didn\\u2019t meet all my expectations, and I am envious of all the people who rave about these shoes.\\n\\nI paid full price for these Crocs and was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope you found it helpful.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"I only just received my pair and these are my first pair of crocs. I got them for around the house, yard and garage. I\\u2019ll wear them a bit more before I do a full review on them but I just wanted to make a comment on sizing. I found a lot of varying opinions on what size to go with for someone with half sizes. I am men's 11.5, slightly wide feet, with most shoes and I went with the 11. They fit perfectly. A little wiggle room in the toes which I don\\u2019t mind. No slipping or discomfort. I almost always just slip them on and go on my way because they fit well enough that I don't need to use that little ankle strap but with that strap, I feel like I could run in these things. That's how well they fit me. So if you\\u2019re trying to decide on whether you should go up or down a size, I, personally, would recommend going down.\\n\\nUpdate 10/9/2023 (4+ weeks later)\\n\\nSo after a little more than a month of wearing these daily, they have become slightly more comfortable due to the break in period. I wear them every day, usually around the house, and it's probably about an hour of total wear a day. It took me about 2-3 weeks before I really started to notice they were breaking in and shaping around my feet so I guess that you can expect them to shape to your feet after about 15-20 hours. Comfort and fit were never an issue but I definitely notice a difference between day one and today. They're softer underfoot and just seem to fit better now.\\n\\nNot sure what else to really say about them. They fit well, strap up or down, they're going to stay on my feet. The comfort is great especially after the break in period. Plenty of grip on the soles.\\n\\nIf I wanted to complain, and this is about as nit-picky as you can get in my opinion, I would say they've already developed a crease on the sides from me squatting down in them which seemed to happen a little quicker than expected. I don't care about creases but some people do. Creases are going to happen on shoes and if you care, you probably go out of your way to avoid them (which I do not) in which case you will probably be fine.\\n\\nI plan on buying a second pair so I have a pair for in the house and a pair for yard work. I'm not sure I would pay 40+ dollars for them, although they're probably worth that, but I purchased these for 32 dollars. I'll keep an eye on some different colors to see if the price will drop below 35 and, if so, I'll purchase them without hesitation.\\n\\nTL;DR: They're comfortable, especially after the break in period. They fit very well (I'd recommend half sizes go down) with straps up or down. If you're on the fence, I'd recommend you purchase them on sale and you won't be disappointed.\"\n",

      "            \"Description\": \"If worn with socks and wth the movable strap behind the heel, Crocks are like walking on a cloud. I like to wear shoes without socks and they are still fairly comfortable around the house that way. They do make your feet sweat when worn for a longer period but I like to slip them off while reading or watching television. If you place the strap up front, it's easier to slip them off and on again for short trips around the house. In short, I wear them walking the dog, shopping, driving and as slippers around the house and love them. Add the low price and you can't go wrong. Oh and, they tend to run a half size larger so order a half size smaller.\"\n",

There\\u2019s no way those were comfortable, they were so worn down that his toes were almost touching the floor through his paper-thin shoe.
